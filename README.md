  🍁 Awesome Maritimes Tech

This repo is my contribution to the tech community across the Canadian Maritime provinces—New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia. 

It highlights resources for anyone looking to build local tech and data communities, explore job opportunities, or get involved in the region's growing tech scene.

This list is a work in progress, and I’ll continue adding to it as I come across new resources.  
If you see something missing, please don’t hesitate to reach out or open an issue!
