# Awesome Maritimes Tech

This repo is my contribution to the tech community across the Canadian Maritime provinces of **New Brunswick**, **Nova Scotia**, and **Prince Edward Island**. 

It highlights resources for anyone looking to grow their local tech and data communities, explore job opportunities, or get involved in the region's growing tech scene.

This list is a work in progress, and I’ll continue adding to it as I come across new resources.  
If you see something missing, please don’t hesitate to reach out or open an issue!

Please share with anyone who might find it useful and give the repo a star.
